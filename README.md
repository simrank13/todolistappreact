# Getting Started with my React To-Do App
This project uses React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, to create a simple and efficient to-do list application. React's component-based architecture makes it easy to manage the state of your to-do items and update the user interface dynamically.

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can use the following scripts:

### `npm start`: 
Runs the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser. The page will automatically reload when you make changes to the code.

### `npm test`: 
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. This allows you to test your components as you develop them.

### `npm run build`:
Builds the app for production to the build folder. This optimizes the app for the best performance and prepares it for deployment.

## Features
Add and Remove Tasks: Easily add new tasks to your to-do list and remove them when they're complete.
Mark Tasks as Complete: Check off tasks as you finish them to keep track of your progress.
Responsive Design: The app is designed to work seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices, ensuring a consistent experience for all users.
